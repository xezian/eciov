# revoice
A game that involves reversing vocal audio clips.

I am buiding this in my free time. It uses the Web Audio API to reverse audio clips, and gives users the opportunity to attempt to reproduce a normal sounding word or phrase by recording it backwards.

My next step is to determine and build file stoarge for the audio clips, and connect the reference urls to the data structure.

This repository contains all my code for the full stack version of the app which is still in development and not yet deployed.

There is another repo with just the front end of this app which can be found [here](https://github.com/xezian/react-revoice)

And also a deployed version of that repo which can be found [here](https://react-revoice.herokuapp.com/)
